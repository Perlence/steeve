Description: Tiny GNU Stowâ€“based package manager
 steeve is not a replacement for any full-fledged package manager like *dpkg* or
 *rpm*, but instead an addition, designed to handle manually built software and
 binary distributions. Instead of polluting ``/usr/local`` with binaries and
 libraries that aren't tracked by any package manager and thus cannot be safely
 removed or upgraded, *steeve* provides a structured approach that allows for
 managing multiple software versions in a matter of a command.
