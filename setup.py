steeve is not a replacement for any full-fledged package manager like *dpkg* or
*rpm*, but instead an addition, designed to handle manually built software and
binary distributions. Instead of polluting ``/usr/local`` with binaries and
libraries that aren't tracked by any package manager and thus cannot be safely
removed or upgraded, *steeve* provides a structured approach that allows for
managing multiple software versions in a matter of a command."""
